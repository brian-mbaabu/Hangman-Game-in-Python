# Hangman-Game-in-Python
This project is a command-line implementation of the classic game Hangman using Python
The Hangman Game allows players to guess a hidden word by suggesting letters. Players have a limited number of lives, and each incorrect guess results in the drawing of a part of a hangman's gallows. The objective is to guess the word before running out of lives.

This Python project includes features such as word selection, tracking of used letters, validation of user input, and displaying the current state of the word. It also utilizes a list of words for word selection and the random and string modules from the Python standard library.

The Hangman Game in Python is an interactive and entertaining project suitable for beginners learning the basics of Python programming. It demonstrates various concepts such as string manipulation, randomization, conditional statements, loops, and user input handling
